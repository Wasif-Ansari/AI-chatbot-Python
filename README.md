# AI Chatbot Python

A conversational AI chatbot built using Python to demonstrate natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning capabilities. This project focuses on creating an intelligent system capable of interacting with users in a natural, human-like way.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Utilizes libraries like `nltk` to process and understand user input.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Implements machine learning algorithms for intelligent responses.
- **Customizable Responses:** Easily extendable for additional functionalities and responses.
- **Simple Interface:** Text-based user interface for easy interaction with the chatbot.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**  
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**
- **TensorFlow (Optional for advanced models)**
- **scikit-learn** (for machine learning tasks)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data handling)
